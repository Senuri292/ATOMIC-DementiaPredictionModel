# ATOMIC-DementiaPredictionModel
Phase 1 of the ModelX by ATØMIC 


<br>
This project involves exploring the NACC Uniform Data Set (UDS), applying feature engineering and preprocessing techniques, and developing a binary classification model to predict the risk of dementia. The pipeline includes data cleaning, handling missing values, feature selection, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and comprehensive evaluation.<br><br>
